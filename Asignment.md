# Mandatory I

Create a website that contains documentation for what you have learned so far.

Assignment type: Individual
Feedback: Random checks, further feedback can be requested. Feel free to also share the website on the Teams channel.

Hand-in type: Git link on Fronter
Deadline: March 30th.
If you do not manage to hand-in the mandatory in time you will have to hand-in in the Teams Channel for approval.


**Requirement on Fronter:**
Fulfill all the weekly homework so far or turn in a minimum 1 page dense paper about the subject where you explain how to solve it and the theory behind it.
**Requirements for the project:**
* Serve the pages with Express.
* Use Server-Side Rendering (SSR).
* Split up the documentation in pages rather than one long HTML page.
* Should have some nice styling (custom or with a styling framework).

**Requirements about the documentation:**
Should contain terminal commands.
Should contain code snippets.
Should contain all the tools we’ve used and explain them.
Should cover all the theory that we’ve touched upon.

**Admin panel:**
We will cover the security aspect of this later in the course which will be the topic of mandatory II. 
For now it’s fine to redirect based on a hard coded password in front end / back end. We haven’t talked about databases yet so you are not expected to use one.

* Create (a) login/signup page(s).
The admin panel should allow users to fill out the content for a new documentation page in the browser.

* Bonus (Which means that this is not a requirement): Allow users to create new pages.


**Bonus:**
Research a covered topic in-depth that you want to understand better.
Learn something new and document it.
